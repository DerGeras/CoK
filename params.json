The height and size of those towers is configurable, and the last team not having a fully build tower wins.\r\n\r\nOnly few ressources are given to each team at start, the rest needs to be farmed and crafted (it is Minecraft after all). Be creative at attacking your oponents towers (by building them) and defending yours!\r\n\r\n### Ressources\r\n[Wiki](wiki)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
