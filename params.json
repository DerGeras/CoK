{"name":"Clash of Kingdoms","tagline":"Clash of Kingdoms Minecraft Mod","body":"![CoK Logo](http://abload.de/img/1920_108073ke9.jpg)\r\n\r\n### What is it?\r\nClash of Kingdoms is a Minecraft mod which started as a Bukkit plugin by @GeMoschen, and is now being ported to Forge with the possibility of including new items, blocks and wepons!\r\n\r\n### The Game\r\nThe game supports up to 16 teams, which are trying to build a tower in the opponents base(s). The height and size of those towers is configurable, and the last team not having a fully build tower wins.\r\n\r\nOnly few resources are given to each team at start, the rest needs to be farmed and crafted (it is Minecraft after all). Be creative at attacking your oponents towers (by building them) and defending yours!\r\n\r\n###Professions\r\n* The king: Wrapped in heavy armour, he is in charge of protecting the own base.\r\n\r\n* The crossbowman: With medium armour and a crossbow as a weapon, the crossbowman is in charge of supporting either the king in defending the base, or being a long-range addition to raids on the other bases.\r\n\r\n* The barbarian: Well, quess. He wields a hammer. A huge hammer.\r\n\r\n###New Weapons\r\nCoK introduces two new weapons:\r\n* The warhammer, while being usable as a normal weapon, can be charged (right-clicking) to release a weak AoE Knockback. Well, it's weak until you enchant it at an anvil.\r\n\r\n* The crossbow, which can be reloaded in advance with iron bolts, deals more damage than a regular bow, and can be enchanted. Oh btw, the bolts have a built-in knockback.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n[Wiki](https://github.com/DerGeras/CoK/wiki)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
