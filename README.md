### What is it?
Clash of Kingdoms is a Minecraft Mod which started as a Bukkit Plugin by @GeMoschen, and is now being ported to forge with the possibility of including new items, blocks and wepons!

### The Game
The Game supports up to 4 Teams, which are trying to build a tower in the opponents base(s). The height and size of those towers is configurable, and the last team not having a fully build tower wins.

Only few ressources are given to each team at start, the rest needs to be farmed and crafted (it is Minecraft after all). Be creative at attacking your oponents towers (by building them) and defending yours!
